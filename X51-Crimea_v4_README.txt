X51 Crimea Scenario

FILE LOCATION:
Unzip files here directly (no subfolder):
...\Multiplayer\Dogfight\X51
So e.g. the .mission file should be here:
...\Multiplayer\Dogfight\X51\X51-Crimea_v4.Mission

When changing location of mission files, use Mission Editor with 'Save As'. This will regenerate all linked files correctly, otherwise stuff breaks.
